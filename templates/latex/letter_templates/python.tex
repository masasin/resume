I did my undergrad in mechatronics engineering in Canada, and my masters in a robotics lab in Kyoto. I have worked in a variety of fields in four countries. I enjoy automating tasks (including using hardware), as well as getting useful insights out of data.

My primary language for the last eight years have been Python, where I focused primarily on the scipy stack. (I even have two packages on PyPI.) I have proven experience in delivering software projects which are well-documented, robust, modular, and maintainable. I have been using Linux as my primary OS since 2009.

During my undergrad, my main focus was on the physical aspect of robotics. My internships included research, electronics, and the design of industrial machines. During my masters, I programmed and controlled robots and drones, using both my own infrastructure and with ROS. I also developed the interface for the drones, ran analyses, and produced visualizations.

I have worked as a data scientist in Antwerp, and an Industry 4.0 consultant and Senior Python Developer in Brussels.
I have also recently started teaching myself machine learning.
